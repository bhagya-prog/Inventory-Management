This is a basic inventory management system created by me as a project at my school. This might sound basic, but I completed this code with the knowledge that I had at that time. 
This code basically asks if they want to open the boss interface or the employee interface, and according to that different options are shown like showing graphs, changing items, deleting items and other stufff. 

This code can be further upgraded in a way that it can be used for a website, where the person is asked to log in and if it is the boss ID the boss interface will be shown . showing the same options as in the code and according to that the output is shown.
